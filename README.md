# Wind-Energy-Systems-Using-Multimodal-Fusion-and-Multi-Agent-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project fuses SCADA data, drone images, maintenance logs, and weather records using TCN, ViT, BERT, and MLP encoders. A cross-attention module creates a unified turbine state, and QMIX-based multi-agent RL selects optimal maintenance actions to reduce failures and cost.
